        <h3>Project description</h3>
        <p>This project was made in Software Engineering course. Myself and four other students were grouped together to
            simulate an agile work environment with 3 week sprints. Our objective was simply to create an app.</p>
        <p>As a group we decided to create a web app using REACT and Django. The premise was a trivia application that
            people could play with their friends, kind of like trivia night at local bars. Initially we planned to do
            like
            a multiplayer hosted session sort of thing but React proved to be more challenging than we anticipated.</p>
        <p>We were succesful in standing up the web app however. You can see the final project results <a
                href="https://klingons-triviaknights.netlify.app">here</a>. The app allows a user to create a profile
            and
            will generate a list of trivia questions based on the user's initial parameters.</p>
        <p>Most of my work went into the game design and UX. I'm quite proud of how it turned out, despite..</p>

    <h2>This site is being transitioned to an Angular based webapp</h2>
    <span class="post">Posted by Sohail on 1-30-2021 - 1:30pm</span>
    <p>The current and ongoing project until completion is to turn this website into webapp using Firebase and
        Angular. Features that I am trying to implement:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User logins</li>
        <li>Profiles with past projects listed</li>
        <li>The ability to post new content through a webform</li>
        <li>A dynamic front page that loads the most recent and relevant projects</li>
    </ul>
    <span>Currently what you are seeing is a prototype of the end goal. Thanks for stopping by!</span>

        <h3>Featured Project -</h3>
        <h1>MSPI 1-Byte Minecraft Processor</h1>
        <span class="post">Posted by Sohail on 1-30-2021 - 1:58pm</span>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>This was a project for Computer Architecture. I designed my own 1 byte processor architecture
                and implemented it in Minecraft. The premise was that learning the cycles of a processor might be
                less abstract if a student could watch the cycles take place and interact with it.
            </p>
            <p>The project was a success in that I was actually able to program a short script in redstone
                and the my professor (Dr.Apan Qasem) offered me the opportunity to develop the idea. You can see the
                result of that work <a href="https://youtu.be/SobCXfsHwbo">here</a>. I also did a breakdown of the
                elements,
                which you can see <a href="https://youtu.be/FSZAUTlHAMk">here</a>. Ultimately, the limitations
                of the minecraft lighting engine made the game quite laggy, so introducing more complexity did not seem
                feasible
                at the time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since then, Minecraft has released a new version of Minecraft that doesn't use Java RTE, and is thus
                somewhat faster at render times. The MSPI map file is completely incompatable, however, and several of
                the redstone mechanisms no longer work after updates to how redstone works. I'm not sure I'll ever be
                able
                to pick this one up again but it was a fun an interesting project for sure.
